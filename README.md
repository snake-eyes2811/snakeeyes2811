# About Me

## My Interests

Hi there! I’m Shawn Benjamin, a 21-year-old Indian-American living in North Carolina and studying Cybersecurity. I’ve moved around quite a bit—Indiana, California, and now here—which has given me a pretty wide view of different communities and tech environments.

Outside of cybersecurity, I’m a musician (guitar, piano, and digital production are my go-to’s) and a martial artist. I love combining logic and creativity—whether I’m diving into Linux scripting, sparring at the dojo, or composing something new in FL Studio. I’m also a big gamer, and *Watch Dogs 2* really got me into the world of hacking and digital activism.

## Websites I Recommend

- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) – One of my favorite platforms for learning and practicing ethical hacking. It's hands-on, real-world, and perfect for anyone studying cybersecurity like I am.

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) – Great for revisiting core concepts in math and computer science. Their clear explanations and interactive lessons make learning feel way less intimidating.

- [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it) – A fantastic resource packed with free courses on cybersecurity, IT, and networking. I’ve used it to deepen my knowledge on real-world security tools and career-focused skills.
